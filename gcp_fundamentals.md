Hot and cold data
In storage, there are two ways to describe data and its availability: hot or cold. Hot data is data
that users access frequently. For example, the data used in mobile apps is hot because users
have instant access to their data.
In contrast, cold data is infrequently or rarely accessed. An example of cold data is data used
for record keeping. You might need to keep this kind of data available, but it doesn’t need to be
updated or accessed often.
Cloud storage
Cloud Storage is Google’s storage product for unstructured data or objects, including email,
web content, images, videos, and audio files. Once stored, objects are then saved in buckets. A
bucket is a virtual container that holds objects.
