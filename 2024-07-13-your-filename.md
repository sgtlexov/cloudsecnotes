## Fundamentals to Cloud Computing

What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. 

compute, networking, or storage services




Cloud service types
### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
Cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. Customer is responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration, etc. The customer is bascically renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter but the customer decides what to do with it.




### Platform as a service (PaaS).
The cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. The customer don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.

This is most suited to a lift and shift migration from an on-premise datacenters to a cloud development.

Why do we need cloud computing?
Prior to the advent of cloud computing, most ccomputing is done in an on-premises datacenter. Which means the customer is responsible for the physical security to the information and data security in their datacenter. 

### Software as a service (SaaS)
With SaaS, the customer is essentially renting or using a fully developed application. For example, Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation.  SaaS is the model that places the most responsibility with the cloud provider and the least responsibility with the user. In a SaaS environment youâ€™re responsible for the data that you put into the system, the devices that you allow to connect to the system, and the users that have access. 

Shared responsiiblity model
The shared responsibility model applies to all the cloud types.
